# Railway deployment

Use one Node 24 Docker service and one persistent volume mounted at `/data`. Set `CALBOK_DB_PATH=/data/calbok.sqlite`, `PORT=3000`, a random operator token of at least 32 characters, and `CALBOK_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` to the exact HTTPS origin. Provider credentials are runtime variables. Local environment files and data are excluded from upload and Docker builds.

The public `/api/health` endpoint checks SQLite without exposing records. Journal APIs require the operator token; paste it into Integration settings. Keep one replica because storage and rate limits are local to the service. Configure the health check to `/api/health`.

Startup listens on `0.0.0.0` and Railway's `PORT`. Existing local receipts are not copied to production. Back up the volume before destructive maintenance.
